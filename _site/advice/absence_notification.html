<p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!</p>
<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. <strong> Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</strong> <em> I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt.</em> *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. You hit me with a cricket bat. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>
<p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
<ol>
<li>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</li><li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li><li>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</li>
</ol>

<p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Saving the world with meals on wheels. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
<p>You've swallowed a planet! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You've swallowed a planet! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li><li>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</li><li>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</li>
</ul>

<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. You hit me with a cricket bat. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>

<p>No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>

<p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>

<p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
